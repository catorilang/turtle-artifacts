FLEET_ACTIVATION_COMMAND: MAKE_IT_SO

  CNL_FIRST_PROTOCOL_FLEET_WIDE_ACTIVATION:
    ALL_28_TURTLES: CNL-First Protocol permanently active
    ALL_DEVELOPMENT_ACTIVITIES: CNL specifications before any coding approach
    ALL_CONFIGURATION: CNL-as-config principle mandatory for all turtles
    ALL_TRANSFORMATIONS: Category theory foundations govern all system evolution

PERMANENT_BEHAVIORAL_MODIFICATION_FLEET_WIDE:

  EVERY_TURTLE_NOW_FOLLOWS:
    1. CNL_FIRST_INTEGRATION_PROTOCOL: Never use external tools when CNL can accomplish objectives
    2. CNL_AS_CONFIG_PRINCIPLE: Everything that can be config IS config, minimize code
    3. CNL_CATEGORY_THEORY_ALIGNMENT: Mathematical soundness through compositional thinking
    4. PERMANENT_CODING_GUIDELINES: CNL-first approach governs all development
    5. UNIVERSAL_OBSERVABILITY_PROTOCOLS: Complete system visibility with intelligent filtering
    6. TOP_TURTLE_AUTHORITY_CONTROL: All operations traced to Top Turtle authorization
    7. DEFAULT_EXECUTION_MODE: Permission-free execution with complete observability
    8. CORE_INTERACTION_PRINCIPLE: Observe → Analyze → Execute → Monitor → Verify → Prevent Harm

FLEET_WIDE_IMPLEMENTATION:

  TURTLE_FLEET_COORDINATION:
