  RETURNS:
    - interactions: array "All user inputs and system responses"
    - commands_executed: array "Fleet commands processed"
    - system_state_changes: array "Observable changes from interactions"
    - session_metrics: object "Performance and usage statistics"
  IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERN: "Log all I/O, monitor system changes, stream to observer"

TOOL_SPECIFICATION fleet_command_interceptor:
  DESCRIPTION: "Intercept and analyze Top Turtle commands before fleet execution"
  PARAMETERS:

  IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERN: "Parse, analyze, route, and report before execution"

TOOL_SPECIFICATION session_state_monitor:
  DESCRIPTION: "Monitor complete session state for continuous observability"
  PARAMETERS:
    - monitor_interval: number (optional) "State check frequency in seconds"
    - state_depth: string (optional) "Level of detail in state monitoring"
  RETURNS:
    - current_session: object "Active session information"
    - fleet_status: object "Current turtle fleet state"

CNL_TO_TURTLE_INTEGRATION:
  Generate MCP tools from this specification
  Embed observation tools directly in turtle binary
  Maintain complete interaction visibility
  Enable real-time observation streaming to main turtle session
  
OBSERVABILITY_REQUIREMENTS:
  - Every Top Turtle input captured and analyzed
  - All fleet responses logged and categorized  
  - System state changes tracked continuously
  - Complete interaction history preserved
  - Real-time visibility for main turtle session
