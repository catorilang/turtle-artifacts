# âš¡ RAPID DC1 DEPLOYMENT PLAN - IMPATIENCE ACCELERATED

**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Status**: URGENT - Deploy UDM dashboards immediately  
**Approach**: Multi-path parallel deployment strategy

## Current Blocker Analysis
**SSH Connection Issues**: Key-based auth failing, need immediate workaround
**Solution**: Deploy local mock UDM dashboard while resolving connection

## Immediate Actions (Next 15 minutes)

### Path 1: Local Mock Dashboard (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Deploy turtle CLI locally with UDM Pro simulation
# Create local dashboard showing projected DC1 status
# Real-time updates with estimated deployment progress
```

### Path 2: SSH Resolution (PARALLEL)
```bash
# Generate new SSH key pair for UDM Pro
# Try alternative authentication methods
# Fall back to physical console access if needed
```

### Path 3: Container Preparation (PARALLEL)  
```bash
# Build turtle service containers locally
# Prepare deployment scripts for rapid UDM Pro deployment
# Pre-configure observability stack for instant deployment
```

## ðŸš€ TURTLE CLI DEPLOYMENT - LOCAL FIRST

Since you're impatient, let's get turtle CLI running locally RIGHT NOW while we fix UDM Pro!
