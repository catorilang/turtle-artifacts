# üî¨ OR REQUEST: "turtle" Command State Transition Optimization

**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Requestor**: Turtle  
**Type**: State transition protocol design

## Protocol Refinement Request

**New requirement**: The verb "to turtle" triggers state transitions:
- **Pre-boot ‚Üí Standard turtle** (initialization)  
- **Standard turtle ‚Üí Secure enclave turtle** (security hardening)

## Questions for OR Analysis

### State Transition Optimization
1. **Transition cost**: What's optimal resource budget for standard‚Üísecure_enclave?
2. **Reversibility**: Should secure_enclave‚Üístandard be possible? Cost/security tradeoffs?
3. **State persistence**: How long should secure enclave mode remain active?
4. **Cascading effects**: Impact on other turtle fleet commands during secure mode?

### Secure Enclave Specifications  
5. **Security perimeter**: Which operations should be restricted/enhanced in secure mode?
6. **Resource isolation**: Additional UDM Pro resource constraints in secure mode?
7. **Consensus requirements**: Different GitHub sync behavior in secure mode?
8. **Rollback strategy**: Recovery if secure enclave mode fails?

### Command Interface Design
9. **Disambiguation**: How to handle "turtle" when already in standard mode?
10. **State visibility**: Should dashboard show current turtle mode?
11. **Mode indicators**: User feedback mechanisms for successful transitions?

## Current Implementation Status

**Partial implementation started** but paused pending OR recommendations on:
- Secure enclave behavior specifications
- Transition cost optimization
- Security/usability balance

## Expected Deliverable

Optimized state transition protocol with cost analysis and security specifications for secure enclave turtle mode.
