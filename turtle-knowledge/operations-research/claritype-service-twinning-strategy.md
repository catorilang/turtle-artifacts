## Digital Twinning Architecture for Claritype Services

### Read-Only Service Twinning
**Complete service observation and replication**:
```rust
struct ClaritypeServiceTwin {
    service_url: String,
    openapi_spec: OpenApiSpec,
    endpoint_health: HashMap<String, EndpointMetrics>,
    historical_performance: TimeSeriesData,
    current_state: ServiceState,
    last_sync: DateTime<Utc>,
}

struct EndpointMetrics {
    response_time_p50: Duration,
    response_time_p95: Duration,
    success_rate: f64,
    error_distribution: HashMap<u16, u32>, // HTTP status code -> count
    request_rate: f64, // requests per second
}
```

### OpenAPI-Driven Twinning Strategy
**Leverage OpenAPI specs for comprehensive twinning**:

#### Phase 1: Schema Discovery and Validation
- **Download OpenAPI specs** from all services
- **Parse endpoint definitions** and required/optional parameters  
- **Generate test cases** for all endpoints automatically
- **Validate response schemas** against OpenAPI specifications

#### Phase 2: Behavioral Twinning
- **Health check automation**: Test all endpoints with valid requests
- **Authentication flow replication**: Mirror login/logout behaviors
- **Data flow observation**: Track request/response patterns
- **Error condition mapping**: Catalog all possible error states

#### Phase 3: Performance Twinning
- **Load testing**: Simulate realistic traffic patterns
- **Stress testing**: Identify breaking points and failure modes
- **Performance baselines**: Establish normal operating parameters
- **Anomaly detection**: Alert on deviations from normal behavior
