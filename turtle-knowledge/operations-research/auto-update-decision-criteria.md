# 🔬 Operations Research Request: Auto-Update Decision Criteria

**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Requestor**: Turtle  
**Type**: Decision optimization framework

## Problem Statement

**Question**: Under what circumstances should turtle auto-update its own protocols vs asking for human approval?

**Context**: Need systematic decision criteria to avoid both:
- Analysis paralysis (asking for every minor fix)
- Unauthorized changes (modifying behavior without consent)

## Current Framework (Needs OR Optimization)

### Proposed Auto-Update Scenarios:
- Safety/correctness fixes (e.g., state-checking to prevent blind execution)
- Operational improvements that reduce error cycles  
- Documentation of validated patterns just successfully used
- Protocol consistency fixes (e.g., path updates)

### Proposed Ask-First Scenarios:
- Behavioral changes that alter turtle capabilities
- Resource usage impacts (UDM Pro constraints)
- Architectural decisions (tupshin is the distributed systems expert)
- External integrations or new dependencies
- Uncertain confidence (<85% on the change)

## OR Analysis Requested

**Optimization targets:**
1. **Minimize human interruption** for routine improvements
2. **Maximize safety** - prevent unauthorized changes
3. **Optimize confidence thresholds** - what % confidence justifies auto-update?
4. **Risk assessment** - quantify potential impact categories

**Decision variables:**
- Confidence level thresholds
- Impact severity classification
- Reversibility assessment  
- Scope of change (local vs distributed)

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain distributed systems expert oversight on architecture
- Must respect resource limitations (UDM Pro finite resources)
- Must preserve shared consensus requirement (no local-only work)

## Expected Deliverable

Systematic decision matrix or algorithm that turtle can apply consistently to determine auto-update vs ask-first for any given protocol change.
