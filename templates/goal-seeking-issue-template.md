# Goal-Seeking GitHub Issue Template

## üê¢ Goal Definition Issue Template
Use this template when creating goals for turtle achievement rather than task assignment.

```markdown
## üéØ Goal: [Concise goal statement]

### Objective Definition
**What needs to be achieved**: [Clear description of desired end state]
**Current State**: [Description of current situation]  
**Success Vision**: [What success looks like when achieved]

### Success Criteria (Measurable)
- [ ] **Primary Metric**: [Quantifiable achievement measure]
- [ ] **Secondary Metrics**: [Additional success indicators]  
- [ ] **Validation Method**: [How achievement will be verified]
- [ ] **Timeline Target**: [When goal should be achieved]

### Goal Context
**Business Value**: [Why this goal matters]
**User Impact**: [How achievement benefits users]
**System Impact**: [How achievement affects overall system]
**Dependencies**: [What this goal depends on]

### Goal Constraints  
**Resource Limits**: [Available turtle units, time, budget]
**Technical Constraints**: [Technology/platform limitations]
**Authority Boundaries**: [What turtle is authorized to change]
**Risk Tolerance**: [Acceptable risk levels for goal pursuit]

### Goal Achievement Approaches (Optional)
**Turtle Exploration**: Let turtle discover optimal approaches
**Known Approaches**: [If specific approaches are suggested]
**Approach Constraints**: [Any approaches to avoid]

### Human Involvement Level
- [ ] **Autonomous**: Turtle achieves goal independently with progress reports
- [ ] **Guided**: Human provides direction on approach selection  
- [ ] **Collaborative**: Active human participation in goal achievement
- [ ] **Supervised**: Human approval required for major decisions

üê¢ **Goal Assignment**: This goal will be assigned to appropriate turtle seeker for achievement
üéñÔ∏è **Success Definition**: Goal considered achieved when all success criteria met
üìä **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates expected on goal achievement progress  
```

## ‚ùå Avoid Task-Oriented Language
**Instead of**: "Deploy X", "Create Y", "Fix Z", "Implement ABC"
**Use**: "Achieve faster performance", "Improve user experience", "Establish secure environment", "Enable feature capability"

## ‚úÖ Goal-Seeking Language Examples
- "Achieve 50% faster query performance for user searches"  
- "Establish comprehensive security posture with threat detection"
- "Enable seamless user onboarding experience"
- "Optimize system resource utilization for cost efficiency"  
- "Improve development team productivity through automation"

## üê¢ Turtle Goal-Seeking Process
1. **Goal Analysis**: Turtle examines objective and success criteria
2. **Approach Discovery**: Turtle explores multiple paths to achievement  
3. **Strategy Selection**: Turtle chooses optimal approach or spawns competing strategies
4. **Seeker Deployment**: Turtle spawns specialized seekers as needed
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Regular updates on goal achievement progress
6. **Success Validation**: Verification that goal has been achieved
7. **Knowledge Integration**: Learnings captured for future goal achievement
