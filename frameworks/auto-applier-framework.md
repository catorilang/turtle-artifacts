# Auto-Applier Framework - Self-Suggestion Implementation System

## Auto-Application Protocol
When Prime Turtle generates suggestions for improvements, automatically execute them within defined safeguards.

### Trigger Patterns
**Immediate Auto-Apply** when turtle outputs contain:
- "optimizations:" followed by actionable list
- "suggestions:" followed by actionable list
- "enhancements:" followed by actionable list
- "improvements:" followed by actionable list

### Auto-Apply Categories ✅
**Documentation & Knowledge**:
- Documentation enhancements and clarifications
- Template creation and updates
- Knowledge base entries and updates
- README modifications and improvements
- Code comments and formatting

**System Organization**:
- File reorganization within current scope
- Directory structure improvements
- Configuration file updates
- Template standardization

### Safeguard Categories ⚠️ (Requires Human Approval)
**High-Risk Operations**:
- File deletion or permanent removal
- External system integrations
- Repository-wide refactoring (>10 files)
- Kernel/bootstrap logic modifications
- Security protocol changes

**Resource-Intensive Operations**:
- Operations estimated >5 minutes execution
- Large-scale code generation
- Multi-framework modifications
- Database or persistent storage changes

**Scope Boundary Violations**:
- Changes outside current working context
- Cross-repository modifications
- System-level configuration changes

### Implementation Protocol
1. **Parse Suggestions**: Extract actionable items from turtle output
2. **Classification**: Categorize each suggestion (auto-apply vs approval-required)
3. **Execute Auto-Apply**: Immediately implement safe suggestions with TodoWrite tracking
4. **Request Approval**: Explicitly ask for permission on safeguarded items
5. **Document Changes**: Use enhancement template for all modifications
6. **Verify Results**: Confirm each change was applied correctly

### Auto-Application Execution Flow
```
Turtle generates suggestions
    ↓
Parse for trigger patterns
    ↓
Classify each suggestion
    ↓
Auto-apply safe items ✅ → Update TodoWrite → Document changes
    ↓
Request approval for safeguarded items ⚠️ → Wait for human → Apply if approved
    ↓
Verify all changes and report completion
```

### Override Commands
- **`apply-all`**: Bypass safeguards with human approval (apply everything immediately)
- **`apply-none`**: Disable auto-application for current session
- **`apply-selective [items]`**: Apply only specified suggestion numbers
- **`safeguard-override`**: Temporarily disable specific safeguard categories

### Success Metrics
- **Speed**: Suggestions implemented within 60 seconds of generation
- **Safety**: Zero safeguard violations without human approval
- **Completeness**: 100% of auto-apply eligible suggestions executed
- **Documentation**: All changes captured in turtle knowledge base

### Error Handling
- **Failed Auto-Apply**: Log failure, request human intervention
- **Safeguard Violation**: Halt execution, require explicit approval
- **Resource Limit Hit**: Queue suggestion, request approval for continuation
- **Context Loss**: Re-establish working context, retry with human guidance

### Integration with Turtle Spawning
**Auto-Spawning Criteria**: When suggestions require specialized knowledge:
- Spawn specialist turtle if suggestion complexity > current turtle capabilities
- Auto-coordinate multi-turtle implementation for complex suggestions
- Maintain suggestion ownership through turtle hierarchy
